# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

This movie recommendation system is designed to provide personalized movie suggestions to users based on their historical ratings and preferences. It utilizes collaborative filtering algorithms, including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and a baseline popularity-based model to generate movie recommendations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
- Movie rating dataset (e.g., MovieLens dataset)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd movie-recommendation-system
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Collection
Collect and preprocess movie rating data. Ensure data quality and format are compatible with the recommendation models.
Training and Evaluation
Train collaborative filtering models, including SVD, using the collected data.
Continuously evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE to ensure accuracy.
User Interface
Create a user-friendly interface to interact with the recommendation system.
Allow users to receive and provide feedback on movie recommendations.
Recommendation Models
Collaborative Filtering: This system employs collaborative filtering techniques, including SVD, to analyze user-movie interactions and generate personalized recommendations.
Popularity-Based Model: A baseline popularity-based recommender is included for cases where personalized data is limited.
Evaluation Metrics
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): RMSE is used to measure the accuracy of movie rating predictions, helping to evaluate model performance.
Project Structure
/data: Store movie rating datasets and data preprocessing scripts.
/models: Implement collaborative filtering models and evaluation scripts.
/interface: Develop the user interface for interaction.
/tests: Include unit tests and evaluation scripts.
/docs: Documentation and project-related files.
/scripts: Utility scripts and data collection tools.
